The re-design for Munich's visual communication system is meant to enhance the clarity and ease of navigation, as well as to create a friendlier, more approachable international image. \r\n\u200b\r\nTaking inspiration from Munich's culture, this identity system incorporates traditional Bavarian patterns and letter forms. The color palette, composition, and logo all serve to update the city's image and evoke a kind-spirited attitude."
